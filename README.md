# BeatSaberModManager

### About
BeatSaberModManager is yet another mod installer for Beat Saber, heavily inspired by [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). \
It strives to look more visually appealing and support both Windows and Linux, while still being as feature-rich as ModAssistant.

### Features
- Windows and Linux support
- Dependency resolution
- Installed mod detection
- Mod uninstallation
- Theming support
- OneClick™ support for [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com), [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com) and [Playlists](https://bsaber.com/category/playlists)

### Installation
- Download the latest version for you platform from [Releases](https://github.com/affederaffe/BeatSaberModManager/releases)
- Run the executable

### Usage
1. **Run the game at least once before trying to mod the game!**
2. Now check / uncheck the mods you wish to install or uninstall and press <kbd>Update Mods</kbd>.
   Unlike ModAssistant, there is no extra <kbd>Uninstall</kbd> button, installed mods that are unchecked will automatically be uninstalled.
3. Mods are installed to `IPA/Pending` until the game is run. Boot the game to complete mod installation.

### Common issues
**I hit install, but I don't see anything in game!** \
Double check that you followed the [Usage](#Usage) instructions correctly.
Make sure you're looking in the right place. Sometimes mod menus move as  modding libraries/practices change.

**I don't see a certain mod in the mods list!** \
Mod Assistant uses mods from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com/) and shows whatever is available for download. If you need to install a mod manually, please refer to the [Beat Saber Modding Group Wiki](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#manual-installation).

**I hit install but now my game won't launch, I can't click any buttons, I only see a black screen, etc** \
